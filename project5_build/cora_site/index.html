            <h2>why do we <br> value the objects <br> we value?</h2>

            <p class="white">Objects and Power examines the systems surrounding collections, investigating how history
                is
                told through the
                acquisition, presentation, and interpretation of art, artifacts, and texts. The ten artists in the
                exhibition address varied topics that speak to how objects relate to power, such as the roots of
                collecting
                and museums; instances of extraction, theft, and erasure; themes of Indigeneity, access, and ownership;
                and
                examples of artists and community groups telling stories and imbuing power to objects on their own
                terms.
            </p>

            <p class="white">Museums, libraries, and archives are repositories of objects and information that tell
                narratives about human
                history. While these organizations carry a weight of authority regarding art, artifacts, and documents,
                institutions are not neutral; connections to wealth, conquest, and extraction are woven throughout their
                holdings and infrastructure. While many institutions are doing work to confront the complicated
                provenance
                within their collections, Objects and Power features contemporary artists who consider these problems in
                their work—either directly or by circumvention. Be it through unpacking and critiquing power structures
                or
                through material directly carrying power in resistance, Objects and Power connects the dots between the
                objects we care about and the “work” these objects are doing.</p>

            <p class="white">Objects and Power reflects continued conversations, within and beyond the ICA at MECA&D,
                about
                the role of
                art institutions and their inherent responsibilities. Many artists, historians, arts administrators,
                faculty, students, and community members have shared forms of knowledge about how objects relate to
                power
                through their own work, shared conversation, and/or community action. Objects and Power is organized by
                Iris
                Williamson (Director of Exhibitions), Lyra Noumena '26 (Curatorial Intern), Sarah Sawtelle '19
                (Exhibitions
                Coordinator), Caroline Kouba '22 (Exhibitions Assistant); with support and collaboration from freelance
                preparators and ICA Student Staff.</p>

            <p class="white">Thanks to MECA&D faculty collaborators including Rose Logie (Visiting Assistant Professor,
                Academic Studies),
                Benjamin Spalding MFA '17 (Assistant Professor of Sculpture & Foundation, Foundation Program Chair),
                sabine
                stxrm (Chair of Academic Studies and Associate Professor of Environmental Humanities), John Portlock
                (Assistant Professor of Liberal Arts and Chair of the Diversity Committee), Kyle Patnaude (Associate
                Professor, Metalsmithing & Jewelry) (among others); to MECA&D student collaborators including Francy
                HInds
                '25 and Casey Matȟó '25; and to the many MECA&D staff members for their support and contribution towards
                the
                exhibition. Many thanks to groups and individuals near and far for continuing to unpack histories and to
                complicate our relationship with art and objects </p>

            <p class="white">Generous support for the exhibition was provided through the Jeremy Moser and Laura Kittle
                Fund.</p>
