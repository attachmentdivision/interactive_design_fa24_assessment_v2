        <h3 class="artist_desc">Nyeema Morgan's conceptually layered works are characterized by an interplay between
            text, image, and object. Through references to familiar cultural material (popular jokes, canonical
            artworks, recipes, etc) her works point to the soft aesthetic power of systems of knowledge, information
            production, and the mechanics of representation.</h3>

        <h2>about the work</h2>

        <p class="white">Nyeema Morgan's meticulous drawings, sculptures, and installations deploy non-identical
            repetition and juxtaposition to prompt reflection on the mechanics of representation and its political and
            social underpinnings and consequences. A sensual conceptualist, her formal strategies trouble the
            relationship between image and text (language and vision), and call into question how language mediates
            experience, as well as how such mediation can be represented visually. “Soft Power. Hard Margins.” is a
            series of neoclassical, partially gilded cast resin frames, each internally illuminated and framing a
            “canonical” artwork obscured by a sheet of frosted Plexiglas. Inspired by Adrian Piper's assertion that “the
            right to freedom of expression is a permission, granted by the state, to engage in certain activities,”
            Morgan etched the “permission” granted by each work into its face in her signature, typographically
            fragmented style. Installed in salon-style clusters, the works vary between three set sizes, a strategy
            alluding to their referents' likelihood of recognition by the viewer while simultaneously highlighting that
            “the viewer” is ideologically constructed.</p>

        <p class="white">In a moment of renewed attempts to deconstruct or expand existing canons as well as reactionary
            undertakings to defend them, “Soft Power. Hard Margins.” approaches its sources with neither condemnation or
            valorization. Instead, the inherently unstable relationships between the elements of each work (size, frame,
            fragmented text, and partially-obscured image) complicates their legibility and requires the viewer—whatever
            the particularities of their identity and history—to contend with the ambiguous nature of artistic legacy
            and “greatness,” authorship, and cultural inheritance. Furthermore, by undermining the power relations that
            legitimize interpretation, “Soft Power. Hard Margins.” elegantly limns the gaps between presentation,
            representation, and endorsement and materializes, as Piper added, that “not everything that is permitted is
            required, nor can everything that is permitted be justified.”</p>
