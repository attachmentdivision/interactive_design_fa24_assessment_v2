            <p>   makes work about the social and political contexts that influence how intangible things, such as sounds, language, and history, have been framed through the fields of linguistics, history, and conservation. It considers the way institutions shape inherited codes and forms and, conversely, how objects can shape the contexts in which they are placed. Porras-Kim (b. 1984, Bogotá) lives and works in Los Angeles and London. She received an MFA from CalArts and an MA in Latin American Studies from UCLA. She was a Fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University (2019), the artist-in-residence at the Getty Research Institute (2020-22), and is currently a fellow at Museo delle Civiltà in Rome.

<p class="quotation">On the night of September 2nd, 2018, a fire devastated the National Museum of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro, destroying almost all of its historical and scientific collections. Among these precious objects were the remains of Luzia, the skeleton of a human female discovered in a cave in the 1970s. After the fire, museum staff proposed reconstructing Luzia’s body using information obtained through DNA testing. In keeping with Porras-Kim's practice of writing letters to museum officials, the letter is addressed to the National Museum Director, Alexander Kellner, with a request: instead of reconstructing Luzia from her remains and presenting her once again as a scientific object, they could treat her like a human being, letting her ashes rest with respect. Through this work, Porras-Kim also scrutinizes the customs that govern the exhibition of human remains. How do we decide which objects are to be preserved over others?
