          <div class="descrip"><h2>Nyeema Morgan</h2>
            <p>  conceptually layered works are characterized by an interplay between text, image, and object. Through references to familiar cultural material (popular jokes, canonical artworks, recipes, etc) her works point to the soft aesthetic power of systems of knowledge, information production, and the mechanics of representation.
